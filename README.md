# BlockStrike Royale — Godot 4 Android prototype

The repository now includes a separate playable Godot 4 3D prototype in [`godot/`](godot/). It is an original voxel-style battle royale sandbox with Android landscape controls, bots, weapons, a shrinking safe zone, procedural map, local progression, cosmetic UI, and an explicit LAN/network boundary. Read [`godot/README.md`](godot/README.md) for run/export instructions and the verified unfinished-feature list. No APK is claimed because this checkout does not include the Godot/Android build toolchain.

# 🏁 Bash Baqi Racing

لعبة سباق كارت ثلاثية الأبعاد كاملة بالمتصفح — سيارات باغي على الشاطئ، متجر، بطولة، وخرائط عشوائية!
A full 3D kart-racing game in the browser — beach buggies, a huge shop, a championship, and random tracks!

**▶ Play:** serve the folder with any static server and open it:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# → http://localhost:8000
```

No build step, no external CDN — everything is procedural and vendored (Three.js r170 included in `vendor/`).

## 🎬 فيديو ترويجي — 60 ثانية أنيميشن

A **1-minute vertical cartoon trailer** (1080×1920, 24 fps) with a fully synthesised
soundtrack is included: **[`video/bash-baqi-racing-60s.mp4`](video/bash-baqi-racing-60s.mp4)**

title card → beach cruise → dune ramp backflip → `TURBO!` duel overtake → `FINISH` + trophy → sunset logo card.

Everything is generated from code (no stock footage/music):

```bash
python3 tools/video/audio.py  --out /tmp/track.wav      # music + SFX synth
python3 tools/video/cartoon.py --encode video/bash-baqi-racing-60s.mp4 --audio /tmp/track.wav
```

See **[`tools/video/README.md`](tools/video/README.md)** for the scene timeline and all the knobs.

## 📱 Install on your phone — كأنها APK!

The game is a full **PWA** (Progressive Web App): installable, fullscreen, **works offline**, its own icon — no APK file needed.

1. Open the game link on your phone (Chrome on Android / Safari on iPhone)
2. Tap **📱 Install** button inside the game's garage, **or** browser menu `⋮` → **"Add to Home screen" / "تثبيت التطبيق"**
3. Done — the 🏁 buggy icon sits on your home screen and launches **fullscreen like a real app**

> **Want a real `.apk` file?** Host this repo anywhere public (e.g. enable **Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch** in GitHub — one tap), then go to **pwabuilder.com** on your phone, paste the link, and it gives you a signed APK to download. No PC needed.

**Offline play** is built-in: a service worker caches all game files on first visit.

## 🕹️ Controls

| Action | Keys |
|---|---|
| Drive | `W A S D` / arrows (auto-gas on mobile) |

| Reset on track | `R` |
| Horn | `H` |

## 🧱 Tech — 100% procedural

- **Three.js r170** (vendored, zero runtime dependencies) with a hand-written **bloom pass** (threshold + separable blur + filmic composite + vignette)
- Every track is generated from a seeded closed Catmull-Rom spline: road ribbon mesh, terrain sculpted *away from the spline*, themed decor merged into single draw calls, start-line arch, item boxes, coins, hot-air balloons 🎈
- Cars & chibi drivers are built from primitives (8 car archetypes, 16 hat styles, emoji faces)
- All SFX + the island music loop are synthesized live with the Web Audio API — zero audio files
- Arcade kart physics: grip/drift model, off-road slowdown, rubber-banding AI, homing rockets, spin-outs, dust particles

## 📦 Legacy browser build

The original Bash Baqi Racing web/PWA build remains in the repository for reference and offline browser play. There is no checked-in Bash Baqi APK in this checkout. The Android deliverable for the new project is the Godot 4 project in [`godot/`](godot/); its export requirements and current APK status are documented in [`godot/README.md`](godot/README.md).
